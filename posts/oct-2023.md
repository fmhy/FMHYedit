**Wiki Updates**

* Created a **[List of Guides](https://rentry.co/fmhy-guides)** on rentry. This page is automated and updates itself anytime a new rentry is added or removed from FMHY. You can also download the guides yourself by using this [script](https://gist.github.com/Rust1667/efc055debaf4876e4de39cc0d32f18c1).

* Made a [Pok√©mon](https://fmhy.pages.dev/gamingpiracyguide/#pok%C3%A9mon-tools) section in Gaming Tools and an [Email](https://fmhy.pages.dev/internet-tools#email-tools) section in Internet Tools. 

* Added [emojis](https://i.imgur.com/mgYq8nF.png) to indicate when we're linking 3rd party indexes, or our storage page: 

 üåê = 3rd Party Indexes (i.e. /r/PiratedGames Mega, Awesome Lists etc.)

 ‚Ü™Ô∏è = Storage Links
