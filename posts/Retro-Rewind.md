# What is Retro Rewind?

[Retro Rewind](https://discord.gg/qbr3Y4PJFH) is a Mario Kart Wii custom track distribution that features ***every retro track*** from Super Mario Kart to Mario Kart 7, as well as some from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart Tour, totaling 152. Retro Rewind can be played online in public rooms with Dolphin Emulator, a Wii or WiiU.

It also features many [enhancements](https://ibb.co/RCckmdT) such as:

* Max VR has been increased from 9999 to 30000.
* Thunderclouds are now [Mega Clouds](https://i.imgur.com/8H54rGH.mp4), which give Mega Mushrooms, rather than shrinking.
* Added (optional) inside drift to all vehicles, meaning more of them are competitive. 
* Outside drift bikes have an extra level of mini turbo, and karts have three levels, similar to MK8DX.
* Vehicles can brake while drifting, making all tracks playable, and more vehicles viable.
* Ability to change or randomize vehicle/character combo between races.
* Significantly faster menu animations and load times between races.
* Unpopular modes like 100cc and mirror have been removed from online.

# Things to Note

* WheelWizard can be slow, especially if you're installing RR for the first time, so it may be worth doing [manually](https://youtu.be/ZiQ7WAOlJOk) instead to speed up the process. 

* You need to turn on things like inside drift, fast menus, and finishing times in the Retro Rewind settings.

* Retro Rewind uses a modified version of WiiLink, meaning it does NOT require a NAND to play online with Dolphin.

* If using your mouse as a wiimote isn't working well, try switching to "above tv" in Wii settings. 

* To use a real gamecube controller on PC you'll need an [adapter](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/guides/how-use-official-gc-controller-adapter-wii-u/).

* Open-Host can be enabled by pressing start or + on the Retro WFC friend menu. This will allow anyone to join your games via friend code, even if you don't have them added yourself.

* If you don't know anything about Mario Kart Wii, or why it has a cult following 16 years after its release, I'd suggest checking out [TWD98](https://www.youtube.com/@TWD98). Troy plays a lot, so its a good way to learn about the game and improve.
