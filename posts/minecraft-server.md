# Join at: `fmhy.net`

- You will be spawned at the hub.
- To go to vanilla, head to the end portal.
- To go to modded, head to the nether portal.
- Modded requires Minecraft 1.20.1 Forge.
- Vanilla requires Minecraft 1.20.4.

### Mod Downloads

**Attached is the mod pack for modded**:
[RAR](https://qiwi.gg/file/acC63146-mods) + [Guide](https://rentry.org/fmhy-modded)

or you could use the
[`.mrpack files`](https://discord.com/channels/956006107564879872/1206145102217486366/1206145423689908224)
and add it to Prism or other compatible launchers.

### Things to Know

- If it times out when joining then just try rejoining again.
- If you get stuck in the lobby, use the command `/server modded`
  or `/server survival` to join.
- If you can't break blocks or it's glitching, you are probably too close to the
  spawn and need to go farther.
- (Modded) To set a skin, use the `/skin` command.
- To hide yourself from being shown in Dynmap, run this command `/dynmap hide`.
- Simple Voice Chat mod is supported on Modded and (optional) Vanilla servers.
- For modded 6GB+ RAM is required, but 12GB+ is recommended.

Have fun! ♥️
