# pnpm-lock.yaml
# 
# This is the lockfile generated by pnpm, a package manager for Node.js. It
# records the exact versions of all packages that are installed in the current
# project, as well as their dependencies. This file is used to ensure that
# all developers and build systems are using the same versions of packages,
# which can help to prevent version-related bugs and inconsistencies.
#
# The file is organized as a list of package entries, each of which includes
# the package name, version, and a list of dependencies. Here's an example
# entry:
#
#   "typescript":
#     version: "4.5.2"
#     dependencies:
#       ts-node: "10.4.0"
#       tslib: "2.3.1"
#
# In this example, the "typescript" package is pinned to version "4.5.2", and
# it has two dependencies: "ts-node" version "10.4.0" and "tslib" version
# "2.3.1".
#
# It's important to note that this file should be checked into version control
# alongside the rest of the project code, so that all collaborators are using
# the same versions of packages.
