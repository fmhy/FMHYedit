ACE [confirmed today](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-piracy-ring-was-shut-down-by-vietnam-assisted-by-ace-240829/) that they were responsible for getting Fmovies, Aniwave, and Vidsrc all shut down.

***

First I just want to wish everyone involved in these projects the best. I don't know what anyone's exact situation is, but if there is any way we can use FMHY to help support those involved I'd be more than willing to do so.

Fmovies and Aniwave made the world a better place. They archived a huge amount of content, both popular, and obscure, made the lives of many people more comfortable, and those behind these sites should feel very proud of what they were able to accomplish. Sharing in this way is exactly what computers were meant to do, its exactly what *humans* are meant to do, and I am beyond grateful to those who risked their livelihoods to do what is right for so long.

Sadly, with the shutdown of these sites, humanity has lost a huge amount of content in favor of protecting some of the worlds richest companies. ACE has not only decreased the amount of happiness in the world, but they may have ripped a lot of obscure content from existence with no thought whatsoever. I know things seem bad now, but I promise you this isn't the end of the story. 

A long time ago I said that sharing is, always has been, and always will be the right thing to do, and I stand by it 100%. I speak not only for myself, but on behalf of many other pirates when I say sharing is the hill we are willing to die on to protect. It may be the end of Fmovies and Aniwave, but it isn't the end of sharing, not even close.
